## <a name="table-formscsv"></a>Table [forms.csv](./forms.csv)

Word forms are listed as 'counterparts', i.e. as words with a specific meaning. Thus, words with multiple meanings may appear more than once in this table.

## <a name="table-contributionscsv"></a>Table [contributions.csv](./contributions.csv)

WOLD contributions are vocabularies (mini-dictionaries of about 1000-2000 entries) with comprehensive information about the loanword status of each word. Descriptions of how these vocabularies coded the data can be found in the [descriptions](descriptions/) directory.

`Number_of_words` | `integer` | There would be 1814 words in each vocabulary, corresponding to the 1814 Loanword Typology meanings, if each meaning had exactly one counterpart, and if all the counterparts were different words. But many ("polysomous") words are counterparts of several meanings, many meanings have several word counterparts ("synonyms", or "subcounterparts"), and many meanings have no counterparts at all, so the number of words in each database varies considerably.

## <a name="table-borrowingscsv"></a>Table [borrowings.csv](./borrowings.csv)

While a lot of information about the borrowing status is attached to the borrowed forms, the BorrowingTable lists information about (potential) source words. Note that we list loan events per meaning; i.e. one loanword may result in multiple borrowings if the word has multiple meanings.
