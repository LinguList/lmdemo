# Manange vocabulary

by Kristine Hildebrandt

## Age

It should be noted that the ‘age’ information assigned to the words with no evidence of being borrowed in the database is only intended to be an extremely rough guide to time-depth within Tibeto-Burman that cognate forms can be found for these meanings.  So, dates like an age of ‘8th century CE’ for forms that are cognate with similar meanings in at the time that the Tibetan language appeared in written form, or ‘1940’ for forms that appear to be newer loanwords in Manange are not intended to specifically date a particular form in this database, nor are these dates a claim about the particularities of time-depth analysis within Tibeto-Burman.  The topic of time-depth within Tibeto-Burman is filled with debate and uncertainty, and ultimately complementary evidence is needed from outside of linguistics in order to more convincingly posit specific year-spans for cognate forms or loanwords.
